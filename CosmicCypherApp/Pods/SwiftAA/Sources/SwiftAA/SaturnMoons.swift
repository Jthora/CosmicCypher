/// The GalileanMoon struct encompasses all properties of Galilean moons
/// Saturnian Moons are a world by themselves! We'll consider the 7 most important for now.
///
/// Quoting Wikipedia (July 2016):
/// The moons of Saturn are numerous and diverse, ranging from tiny moonlets less than 1 kilometer across to the enormous Titan,
/// which is larger than the planet Mercury. Saturn has 62 moons with confirmed orbits, 53 of which have names and only 13 of which
/// have diameters larger than 50 kilometers. Seven Saturnian moons are large enough to be ellipsoidal in shape, though only two of
/// those, Titan and Rhea, are currently in hydrostatic equilibrium, as well as dense rings with complex orbital motions of their own.
/// Particularly notable among Saturn's moons are Titan, the second-largest moon (after Jupiter's Ganymede) in the Solar System,
/// with a nitrogen-rich Earth-like atmosphere and a landscape including hydrocarbon lakes and dry river networks;[5] and Enceladus,
/// which is seemingly similar in chemical makeup to comets, emits jets of gas and dust and may harbor liquid water under its south pole
/// region.
